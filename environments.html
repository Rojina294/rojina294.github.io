<h2>Infant and Toddler Play Environment </h2>
      <p>Play is the primary mode through which infants and toddlers explore, learn, and make sense of their world. A successful play setting not only enhances the physical development of children but also their emotional, social, cognitive, and sensory development. Spaces for infant and toddler (0–3 years) must be safe, nurturing, and rich in provision for exploring through movement, touching, hearing, and interacting with other people.</p> Creating thoughtful, playful environments encourages question, independence, and happy learning. Spaces which promote belonging, being, and becoming, in terms of the Early Years Learning Framework, support children to feel safe and attached to their early years learning experiences.  </p>
